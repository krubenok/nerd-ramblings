I'm Kyle Rubenok and these are my _Nerd Ramblings_. I don't post very often, and I'm not the greatest writer but having a place to publicly post some hot takes (that will likely be technology related) and keeping some longer term public notes felt like an interesting idea.

I'm currently a PM at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington after completing two summer internships. Previously, I served as the President of the McGill [Computer Science Undergraduate Society](https://mcgill-csus.ca), Co-Director of McGill's largest hackathon, [McHacks](https://mchacks.ca) and sat on the Board of Directors of the [Students' Society of McGill University](https://ssmu.ca/).

Outside of my student involvement, I've been fortunate to have twice interned as a Systems Engineering intern with Cisco Canada. Before that, I experimented with founding a technology consulting business, [Penguinleaf Technologies](https://penguinleaf.com).

I've always been obsessed with technology since I got my very first laptop (a pre-unibody 2008 15" MacBook Pro) and I've been very opinionated about my choices in technology. I hope to express some of these opinions and share what I've learned along the way. I deeply enjoy Homelabbing (having racks of enterprise servers at home), high-end media production (think 4K live broadcasting) and personal productivity empowered by technology.
