I'm Kyle Rubenok and these are my _Nerd Ramblings_. I don't post very often and I'm not the greatest writer but having a place to publicly post some hot takes (that will likely be technology related) and keeping some longer term public notes felt like an interesting idea. 

I'm currently on my way to Microsoft where I will soon be starting as a Program Manager in Redmond Washington after two previous summer internships. Previously, I served as the President of the McGill [Computer Science Undergraduate Society](https://mcgill-csus.ca), Co-Director of McGill's largest hackathon, [McHacks](https://mchacks.ca) and sat on the Board of Directors of the [Students' Society of McGill University](https://ssmu.ca/). 

Outside of my student involvement, I've been fortunate to have twice interned as a Systems Engineering intern with Cisco Canada. Before that, I experiment with founding and incorporating a technology consulting business, [Penguinleaf Technologies](https://penguinleaf.com) with my good friend [Chris Dobson](http://chrisdobson.ca).

I've always been obsessed with technology since I got my very first laptop (a pre-unibody 2008 15" MacBook Pro) and I've been very opinionated about my choices in technology. I hope to express some of these opinions and share what I've learned along the way. I deeply enjoy Homelabbing (having racks of enterprise servers at home), high-end media production (think 4K live broadcasting) and personal productivity empowered by technology.
