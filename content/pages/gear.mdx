**N.B. This is a work in progress and still needs photos and more items added.**

Inspired by Paul Stamatiou's [Stuff I Use](https://paulstamatiou.com/stuff-i-use/), I've decided to catalogue all of the things that I use on a regular basis. This note will be an always evolving document of what I'm currently using. 

## Laptop
I am currently using a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) with a 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9, 32GB of 2400MHz DDR4 Memory, a 512GB SSD and a Radeon Pro 560X 4GB Graphics card. I got this laptop in February of 2019 and have loved it ever since. Like many of the early reviews of this machine mentioned, it does have some mild heat issues but nothing that can't be tamed with some careful software decisions (See macOS software below). 

<!-- TODO: Insert Photo of MacBook Pro -->

I love this laptop. It's plenty powerful for what I need to do and the Thunderbolt 3 expansion opportunity is immense. I'm also not a `vim` user so the lack of physical escape key isn't a huge loss to me an while I find the default Touch Bar experience inoffensive, I also don't find it especially useful. I've got some software tricks (in [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai)) that help to make it genuinely better than a standard function row. 

Performance wise, this machine is great. 32GB of memory is overkill for 80% of what I'm doing by every now and then 16GB would come just a little short and I was planning on having this laptop for a good while so I figured I'd spend the money and get the 32GB option. The 6-core processor is monstrous and I still feel spoiled thinking that 4-cores on a laptop was game changing. 6-cores is handy if I ever need to use a VM on the go and handles multi-tasking without breaking a sweat. The Radeon Graphics are still very clearly laptop graphics but they do manage to drive my 3x4K External Displays without much of an issue though not perfectly. The one mistake I made when configuring it was the 512GB SSD. 500GB used to be plenty of space for my local-disk needs considering the amount I offload to my NAS but I think 1TB is the minimum now. I will not make this mistake again. 

The issue I find myself considering now is if I still want a powerful laptop. The current COVID-19 induced always-at-home has made me reconsider my long-held feelings towards only having one personal computer (generally a laptop) and connecting it to a whole bunch of displays and accessories at a desk to make it an acceptable desktop replacement. Especially now that my days as a student have now ended, I'm starting to fancy the idea of an iMac (Pro???) and a small thin and light MacBook Air or even just using my iPad Pro as my only portable computing device. The other attraction to an iMac Pro would be the significantly beefier internal cooling systems. While the 15" MacBook Pro does manage to stay cool, it is significantly louder than an iMac Pro under twice the load. Laptops are just naturally louder and if I'm not taking too much advantage of the power while I'm on the go perhaps if would be best to split my computing needs into a dedicated high-power desktop and something more portable. Time will tell if I make this change.

## Computer Accessories
I'm going to differentiate the laptop accessories from the items that power my laptop-based desk setup on the criteria of what goes into my backpack vs. what stays at my desk when I take the laptop to go. 

#### Cables
When you get a USB-C Laptop, the very first thing you should do if buy a full set of cables that are all USB-C terminated. When I first got a USB-C Macbook, it was in fact _dongle town, population: me_. Getting Lightning to USB-C Cables, a USB-C Apple Watch Charger, and an external SSD that is USB-C native made all the difference. 

#### Dongles
Thunderbolt 3 gives me basically unlimited expansion opportunity for this laptop. I have a _single_ dongle that I carry in my backpack that takes care of USB-A ports (4 of them), Gigabit Ethernet, SD Cards, an auxillary audio output, HDMI, VGA, and a USB-C power pass-through at up to 100W. I'm carrying fewer dongles with this laptop than my 2015-era Thunderbolt 2 Macbook Pro Retina 15" and gaining super powerful expansion like eGPU's (more on this later).

#### Mouse
It's kinda a no-brainer these days for what high-end productivity oriented mouse one should buy. It stats and ends with the Logitech MX lineup. I am personally using an MX Master 2S which I adore but if I were shopping new I would absolutely go for the MX Master 3S and it's new USB-C Charging Port and the new scroll wheel and design. The MX Ergo and Anywhere are also both appealing to me but I couldn't yet justify the added expense of a second mouse to take with me vs. the one that stays at my desk. I did buy a cheap Amazon travel case for my mouse that stores it nicely when it's in my bag to avoid damage.

#### External SSD
SSD Prices have gone *way* down in recent years, to the point that a 1TB NVMe SSD is a little over 120$ USD. When we hit that kind of pricing I decided to finally jump in and replace my ageing LaCie Rugged Thunderbolt that I have taken apart and switched the SSD/HDD so many times I don't even bother to put the screws back in anymore. I bought an Intel m.2 NVMe SSD and a UBS-C enclosure for it. This thing is a monster performance wise and is way overkill for my overflow storage needs but it comes in handy if I ever need to some Final Cut Pro X work on the go.

#### Belking Thunderbolt 3 Dock
In theory, this dock is almost perfect (maybe with the exception of the price), but in practice, I am not a fan. There is a well known issue with the dock that prevents using the Dipslay Port output at 4k60Hz without annoying flickering and color issues. Belkin support simply initiates a refund if you make a fuss about it. Would I pay for this dock? No way. But it was free so what do I care. They do seem to have a new model out now that is both less expensive and hopefully has this fixed. I don't need the display support as much anymore since my eGPU handles that now, but it does provide the 85W of power needed for my laptop and has ethernet and all the USB support for the desk of the desk's peripherals. 

#### eGPU
TODO.

## Displays

Currently, I am using three Dell P2715Q's that I have acquired over the years. When I first started buying these displays in 2015, they were some of the first IPS, 60Hz 4K displays that weren't absurdly expensive. They have been very good to me over the years and reinforce my notion that buying high end displays will last and still feel relevant for years to come. The design is nothing special (very typical mid 2010's Dell) and the panels are _good enough_. That being said, if I am reviewing them from the lens of 2020, there are some issues I'd like to note: firstly, 4K at 27" is not a high enough pixel density to have a perfect 2x scaling of macOS. The fine folks over at Bjango wrote this up better than I could ever hope [here](https://bjango.com/articles/macexternaldisplays/) but in summary macOS users should aim to follow the size and resulution combinations of the iMac's: 5K at 27" and 4K at 21.5". Unfortuantly the only 5K 27" display I know of at the moment is the LG Ultrafine which is merely ultra.. fine. It's the panel I want to have, but the enclosure and the rest of the experience leave a lot to be desired in a 1000+$ USD monitor. 

I'm not currently planning on upgrading my displays, but when an appropriate *desktop retina* option becomes available I would be very tempted to snatch up two of three of them in a hurry. PS: Yes I'm excluding the Pro Display XDR. It is fabulous but I'm also not going to drop EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS on a single monitor and stand. 

**Monitor Stands** are essential for multi monitor desktop setups and I would argue almost as important for single monitor setups. I am currently using a triple monitor arm from PrimeCables that has a large steel base on my desk. While I would have preferred the clamp-based model, the radiator located under the rear of my desk made that impractical in my Montreal apartment. If possible I will likely upgrade to a 3+1 monitor arm in the future that attached with a clamp rather than a base.

## iPad Pro

My choice of tablet is the 2018 12.9" iPad Pro (64GB, WiFi). I *adore* this tablet and it changed the way I use an iPad. Previously, my use case for an iPad was limited to taking ink-based notes in math and theoretical computer science classes where diagrams and free-form notes are critical but when I upgraded from the orignal 12.9" iPad Pro to this 3rd generation model that use case changed significantly. 

This iPad is my preferred device for writing, consuming content, email, communications and general office-productivity. Something about the ~iOS~ iPadOS productivity model leads to more focused and purposeful use of the device. When I do venture to my laptop, the iPad is still very much in use as a secondary device to keep peripheral items in my field of view. The iPad also serves as my primary device in meetings and on the go. 

Having said all that, if I were to get it again, I would absolutely opt for the LTE equipped model. Yes, I know tethering from my phone is easy, yes I know it's cheaper but there's something about having it be self contained and always connected. Take it up with [John](https://twitter.com/siracusa), [Marco](https://twitter.com/marcoarment) and [Casey](https://twitter.com/caseyliss) if you disagree, they [convinced me](https://atp.fm) of this and I agree 100%.

#### Smart Keyboard Folio

> Apple has announced a new "Magic Keyboard" for the 2018 and 2020 iPad Pros that includes a trackpad. Thankfully it is backwards compatible and will add a second USB-C port to the iPad Pro and most interestingly a trackpad. I plan on upgrading as soon as I cna get my hands on it. Stay Tuned

The Apple Smart Keyboard Folio is a critical accessory for any mobile iPad user. It truly transforms the device into a full-fledged productivity machine that can keep up with a computer for the vast majority of typical office users. While my computer use does extend beyond what an iPad can accomplish, there are enough times that I can live on solely my iPad and having a *full sized* keyboard with it and an excellent kickstand design does wonders. I pefer the origami folding scheme of the folio to the Microsoft Surface style kickstand as it makes the device more lappable and useable on odd surfaces (no pun intended). The keyboard is a joy to type on and the prospect of a trackpad being integrated in the Magic Keyboard is intriguing to say the least.

#### Apple Pencil 
The Apple Pencil is an essential companion for the iPad Pro. Purely as an ergonomic adaptation, it makes the iPad significantly easier to use and opens an entire new arena of use cases that require extreme precision that simply aren't possible with a finger. Yes, Steve Jobs was right when he declared that the best pointing device were our fingers, but when I'm using the Apple Pencil, I'm often not pointing, I'm tracing, sketching, writing or doing a whole manner of different things that never worked well with fingers in the analogue world.
