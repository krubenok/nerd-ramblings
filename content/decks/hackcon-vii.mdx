<Notes>

Beyond my courseload, I've tack on a lot of extra curriculars. Like many of you probably, I find that activities outside of the classroom are more beneficial to my growth than classes.

Because my schedule tends to get cramped pretty quickly, I decided it was important that I focused on being effective with my time to maximize my output while minimizing the time I spend working.

With that said, let's dig into the actual content.

# Project Manager

<Appear>

_The practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints._

</Appear>

<Notes>

So what is a project manager?

_Ideas?_

Ok, here's a definition.

That's a lot of words to say you make sure the projet gets done on time and accomplishes the **right things**.

</Notes>

---

## Project Manager != Boss

<Notes>

There's one other thing I want to pull out of this definition, being a project manager doesn't mean you are the boss. You don't need to be a director or a team lead to have a project manager mentality.

</Notes>

---

<!-- Would be nice to bold the planning point if I can figure it out. -->

<ol>
    <Appear>
        <li>Initiating</li>
        <li>Planning</li>
        <li>Executing</li>
        <li>Controlling</li>
        <li>Closing</li>
    </Appear>
</ol>

<Notes>

From our definition, we have these five steps to project management.

</Notes>

---

1. **Initiating**
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Controlling
5. Closing

<Notes>

This is the first step in starting a project. This is where we layout the end result and try to measure the value of what we are trying to accomplish along with success indicators. Taking the time to process this step lets hackathon organizers determine what is important to their team. This helps to determine what is a priority when crunch time hits.

</Notes>

---

1. Initiating
2. **Planning**
3. Executing
4. Controlling
5. Closing

<Notes>

The meat and potatoes before the meat and potatoes of actually doing the work. The planning step involves outlining all the details of every step required to reach the goals set previously. In this step, we consider every action that needs to be taken, put them in order and consider dependancies for each item.

</Notes>

---

1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. **Executing**
4. Controlling
5. Closing

<Notes>

The actual meat and potatoes. This is probably what most of us spend the majority of our time doing when we work on our hackathons. Here the team is taking actions based on the plan and moving the project forward. Ideally, efficiently.

</Notes>

---

1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. **Controlling**
5. Closing

<Notes>

Just as important as the actual execution of the project is the controlling and monitoring of the project. Here we make sure that we are executing according to plan and that our progress is helping us work towards our end goals. Adjustments can be made here to keep the team on course and maximie progress.

</Notes>

---

1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Controlling
5. **Closing**

<Notes>

Finally, closing is the final delivery of the project. You might thinks that this is the day of your event and in some cases that is correct, but in many cases the true closing of some of your projects might be weeks later after several post-mortems, surveys and other post care has been handled.

</Notes>

---

1. Initiating
2. **Planning**
3. Executing
4. Controlling
5. Closing

<Notes>

For the sake of this talk, I'm going to focus on _planning_ as I think it's the part that hackathons stand to gain the most benfit from and can be the most easily misunderstood.

</Notes>

# Thinking about the project life cycle

<Notes>

What does planning a project actually entail? Typically it's pretty easy to know what the next step towards our goal is but we often don't stop to think about the whole process of achieving that goal.

</Notes>

## Example

<Appear>

# Sponsorship

</Appear>

---

<ol>
    <Appear>
        <li>Cold Emails</li>
        <li>Phone/Email Negotiations</li>
        <li>Contracts</li>
        <li>Post-Sales Love</li>
        <li>Month/Week/Day Of</li>
        <li>Post Care</li>
    </Appear>
</ol>

<Notes>

Let's say that this is our rough sponsorship life cycle.

What common bottleneck do each of these problems have?

</Notes>

---

# People suck at reading emails ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<Notes>

If we consider the entire lifecycle of the project before we begin and start to break it down and write out the steps, efficiecies can often be found where back-and-forths can be eliminated and steps consolidated.

</Notes>

# So how did I solve this?

# A Timeline

<Invert>

</Invert>

<Notes>

When thinking about the timeline of your event, in my experenece it's been easiest to start from the event and work backwards. Think about the things that you want at your event and what the dependancies for that are. Keeping with our sponsorship example, things like opening ceremonies, workshops, prizes, tracks, layouts and more are all needed for various other teams at the event to be able to execute effectively.

In the week of your event the last thing you want to be doing is scrambling to get some obscure detail from a sponsor that isn't answering their emails that could throw off your best laid plans.

</Notes>

---

# A System to Capture this Information

<Notes>

Taking that timeline into account, we can design a repeatable and transparent system that the whole team can implement to make sure information if available and discovereable before people start sending frantic Slack messages.

Having a system to capture the result of your work helps to keep the plan in action and make sure that it is implemented consistently by all members of the team. Adding in new fields ad-hoc leads to confusion and lack of discoverability.

</Notes>

---

# How should I implement this?

<Notes>

Well this part is a bit up to you, we used Notion heavilty for this kind of stuff last yrae but othre tools like Airtable, Google Docs, Office 365 and more can accomplish a similar task.

It doesn't matter so much as long as it's transparent and easily discoverable for the whole team.

# Activity

---

Create a timeline and dependancy tree for an aspect of your hackathon.

-   What information do you need to collect?
-   When to collect information?
-   How will it be recorded?
-   How many steps can we combine?
-   _BONUS:_ Automation ü§ñ

_**10 Minutes to prepare**_

<Notes>

During this time, I should be circulating around the room helping groups work through their systems.

Some ideas:

-   Hacker Registration
-   Judging
-   Opening Ceremonies

</Notes>
