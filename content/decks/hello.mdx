<Notes>

Beyond my courseload, I've tack on a lot of extra curriculars. Like many of you probably, I find that activities outside of the classroom are more beneficial to my growth than classes.

Because my schedule tends to get cramped pretty quickly, I decided it was important that I focused on being effective with my time to maximize my output while minimizing the time I spend working.

With that said, let's dig into the actual content.

# Project Manager
<!-- TODO: Left Right margins on this slide -->
<!-- TODO: Citation formatting in mdx-deck? -->

<Appear>

_the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints._

</Appear>

<Notes>

So what is a project manager? 

*Ideas?*

Ok, here's a definition. 

That's a lot of words to say you make sure the projet gets done on time and accomplishes the **right things**. 

</Notes>

---

## Project Manager != Boss

<Notes>

There's one other thing I want to pull out of this definition, being a project manager doesn't mean you are the boss. You don't need to be a director or a team lead to have a project manager mentality. 

</Notes>

---
<!-- Make these appear one after another. -->
<!-- Highlight the planning item. -->

1. Initiating
2. *Planning*
3. Executing
4. Controlling
5. Closing

<Notes>

From our definition, we have these five steps to project management. For the sake of this talk, I'm going to focus on *planning* as I think it's the part that hackathons haven't put enough weight on in the past. 

</Notes>

---

### Thinking about the project life cycle

<Notes>

What does planning a project actually entail? Typically it's pretty easy to know what the next step towards our goal is but we often don't stop to think about the whole process of achieving that goal. 

</Notes>

Example

<Appear>

## Sponsorship

</Appear>

---

<!-- TODO: make each of these appear one at a time. -->

1. Cold Emails
2. Phone/Email Negotiations
3. Contracts
4. Post-Sales Love
5. Month/Week/Day Of
6. Post Care

<Notes>

Let's say that this is our rough sponsorship life cycle. 

What common bottleneck do each of these problems have?

</Notes>

---

### People suck at reading emails ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<Notes>

If we consider the entire lifecycle of the project before we begin and start to break it down and write out the steps, efficiecies can often be found where back-and-forths can be eliminated and steps consolidated. 

</Notes>

---

## So how did I solve this?

## Timelines

<Notes>

When thinking about the timeline if your event, in my experenece it's been easiest to start from the event and work backwards. Think about the things that you want at your event and what the dependancies for that are. Keeping with our sponsorship example, things like opening ceremonies, workshops, prizes, tracks, layouts and more are all needed for various other teams at the event to be able to execute effectively. 

In the week of your event the last thing you want to be doing is scrambling to get some obscure detail from a sponsor that isn't answering their emails that could throw off your best laid plans. 

</Notes> 

---

### A System to Capture this Information

<Notes>

Taking that timeline into accout, we can design a repeatable and transparent system that the whole team can implement to make sure information if available and discovereable before people start sending frantic Slack messages. 

</Notes>

---

### How should I implement this?

<Notes>

Well this part is a bit up to you, we used Notion heavilty for this kind of stuff last yrae but othre tools like Airtable, Google Docs, Office 365 and more can accomplish a similar task. 

It doesn't matter so much as long as it's transparent and easily discoverable for the whole team.

</Notes>

# Demo

<Notes>

Switch from deck into Notion and give demonstration of sponsorship homepage from McHacks 6.

## Activity

---

Create a timeline and dependancy tree for an aspect of a hackathon. 

- When to collect information?
- How it's recorded and shared?
- How many steps can we combine?
- _BONUS:_ Automation ü§ñ

_**10 Minutes to prepare**_

<Notes>

During this time, I should be circulating around the room helping groups work through their systems. 

Some ideas: 

- Hacker Registration
- Judging
- Opening Ceremonies

</Notes>
